# Scribe - a library to help with writing Babashka scripts

A few utility namespaces extracted from working Babashka scripts and designed to solve common problems simply.

Expanded and refined from [this idea](https://endot.org/2023/12/30/writing-babashka-scripts/#combining-power-with-ease-of-use).
